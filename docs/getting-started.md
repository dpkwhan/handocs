# Getting started

## Live Preview
MkDocs includes a development server, so you can review your changes as you go.
The development server can be started with the following command:

``` sh
mkdocs serve
```

Now you can point your browser to [http://localhost:8000][1] and the Material
theme should be visible. From here on, you can start writing your documentation,
or read on and customize the theme.

  [1]: http://localhost:8000
